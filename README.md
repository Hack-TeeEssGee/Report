### Round 2 review

Amazing work in video, impressed. I am happy that you have come across design making websites sustainable i.e without a tech person always in the loop and nontech guys need to carry out their work without tech person need for every small change (i.e in upload of event content/news etc) through your add event option. waiting to see the whole backend connected and in the swing. Kudos to making it mobile-friendly, much need of the hour ! :)
